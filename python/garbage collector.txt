Python's garbage collector is part of its memory management system, 
automatically deallocating memory that is no longer used.

The primary mechanism for memory management in Python is reference counting.

Each object in Python has a reference count. When the reference count drops to 
zero, the memory is immediately deallocated.

Python's gc module manages the collection of unused objects 

The garbage collector detects and resolves these cycles.
